What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system's
screen or by locking the users' files unless a ransom is paid. More modern ransomware families, collectively categorized as
crypto-ransomware, encrypt certain file types on infected systems and forces users to pay the ransom through certain online
payment methods to get a decrypt key.
